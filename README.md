ðŸš¨WORK IN PROGRESSðŸš¨

A sample app using Apple's CareKit framework, backed by CloudMine storage.

## Getting Started

This demo application requires [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) version 1.0.0 or greater for dependency management. If you don't already have CocoaPods, install the gem:

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

You can then proceed to clone the app, install dependencies, and build it in Xcode:

```
git clone https://github.com/cloudmine/CareKitSampleApp.git
pod install
open BackTrack.xcworkspace
```
